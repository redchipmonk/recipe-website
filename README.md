# website-practice

Hello, welcome to my project. In this project, I am practicing some of my html skills bv using recipes that I find over the internet and recreating them, linking them to one landing page. I have learned about headers, paragraphs, images, and anchoring. I am looking to hone those skills because I am still not confident in my anchoring capabilities. 

I am pretty confident in this project and did not have much difficuly. I did not really have to search anything up. One thing I would like to improve on is my typing speed, so I can be able to work on these projects more efficiently. I would also like to be able to understand Git more and will work on that aspect by reading up more on Git commands and good ways to commit.
